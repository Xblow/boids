# Rusty Boids

## A pure rust implementation of the boids flocking algorithm

This project was undertaken as a means to teach myself rust, a language I'm begining to be quite the fan of. 

This was initially built using the Piston graphics framework but due to some performance issue, it was rewritten to use ggez to take advantage of draw call batching.
